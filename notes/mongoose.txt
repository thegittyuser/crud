What is mongoose?

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

It provides a straightforward way to define schemas, validate data, and interact with MongoDB collections using JavaScript objects.

Key Concepts:

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
Mongoose acts as a bridge between your Node.js application and the MongoDB database, allowing you to:
Define a schema (data structure)
Enforce validation rules
Add middleware and hooks (e.g., for pre-save actions)
Use methods and virtuals for custom logic

Why Use Mongoose?
Schema-based — helps structure data in a flexible database.
Validation — ensures data integrity before saving.
Middleware — allows pre/post hooks (e.g., before saving or deleting).
Query helpers — powerful and expressive query building.
Population — enables easy references between documents.
